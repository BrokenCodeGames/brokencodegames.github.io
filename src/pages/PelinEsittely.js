                The Great War to end all wars has come to a conclusion, but the turmoil and chaos caused by it will still linger in eastern parts of Europe for years to come. Borders are being redrawn by the victorious powers, losing sides are licking their wounds or joining paramilitary groups keen on resisting, while bolshevik forces in Russian Soviet Republic are keen on expanding and rewriting the eastern European borders once more. Affected by all these changes in the middle of them stands young nation of Finland, barely a year old, upon which the bolsheviks have laid their eyes on...<br/><br/>

                In Project Vesiraukka, you take command of a steam-operated submarine in the winter of 1918. Operating this out-dated piece of machinery in the frozen Archipelago Sea, separated and isolated from the main forces and chain of command, your mission is to wage a guerilla warfare on sea against the reds, stop them from spreading their influence and and prevent the Russian bolsheviks from shipping in men and material to help them.<br/><br/>

                - Sail and operate steam-powered submarine based on Nordenfelt I-model, managing its steam pressure, fuel economy, field upgrades and more.<br/>
                - Recreated Archipelago Sea in 1:1 scale.<br/>
                - Operate multiple weapons systems; Torpedo, deck gun and naval mines.<br/>
