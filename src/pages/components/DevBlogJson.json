Technically it could be possible to model everything from need to lubricate bearings and adjusting safety valves of the steam engine or just go with a 2D selectable dial to make engine go fast. Both have their merits and different fanbase. Of course, best possible solution would be an option for the player to choose the desired level of realism. In the end, we probably just end up working with what we have time and resources for."

Scotch Boiler is a type of boiler of relatively good efficiency, but more importantly, it is a compact package and the only type that could realisticly fit inside the submarine's frame while still providing enough heat to generate sufficient amount of power. We are now starting to work on implementing managing the boiler in-game and thus, managing the power you have available for your submarine in the game."

Video of these features to follow. Pictured above, the internal workings of the submarine. If time and resources allow, these will be modelled as well, however artistic liberties have to be taken in creating them, as this is the only known picture to give a hint on how the vessel looked like from inside."
